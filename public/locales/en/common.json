  "subtitle": "This project addresses the transparency of blockchain data by enabling private, encrypted message storage on-chain. Using AES symmetric encryption, it ensures message confidentiality, while SHA-512 hashing strictly enforces access controlâ€”only the message owner can decrypt and view the content. All data is securely stored on-chain, preserving privacy and ensuring immutability. The system is currently live on the Sepolia testnet and available for use.",
